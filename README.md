## Howdy, Stranger!

Vanilla was born out of the desire to create flexible, customizable, and downright entertaining
community solutions. Vanilla has been used to power tens of thousands of community forums around the world
and we couldn't be happier if you've decided to use Vanilla to grow yours.

Every community is unique. Vanilla is a finely-crafted platform on which designers and developers
can build a custom-tailored environment that meets your community's particular needs.

## 5 reasons Vanilla is the sweetest forum

1. We've reimagined traditional forums for mass-appeal.
1. Our theming flexibility is second-to-none.
1. Impossibly good integration options with single sign-ons and embedding.
1. The best tools available for community management.
1. Curated features with great plugin options, not the kitchen sink.

## Releases & Branches

The `master` branch is considered a stable branch capable of being released at any time. Reviewed, stable changes land against `master` via pull-request.

Our open source release branches are named by version number, e.g. `release/3.2`. All open source releases (included pre-releases) are tagged.

The `release/VERSION+BUILD` branches are production-ready branches for our cloud product but are not yet vetted for open source release (alternate platforms & configurations).
