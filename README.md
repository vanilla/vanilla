## Howdy, Stranger!

Vanilla was born out of the desire to create flexible, customizable, and downright entertaining
community solutions. Vanilla has been used to power tens of thousands of community forums around the world
and we couldn't be happier if you've decided to use Vanilla to grow yours.

Every community is unique. Vanilla is a finely-crafted platform on which designers and developers
can build a custom-tailored environment that meets your community's particular needs.

## 5 reasons Vanilla is the sweetest forum

1. We've reimagined traditional forums for mass-appeal.
1. Our theming flexibility is second-to-none.
1. Impossibly good integration options with single sign-ons and embedding.
1. The best tools available for community management.
1. Curated features with great plugin options, not the kitchen sink.

## Installation

The current version of Vanilla requires PHP 7.2+ and MySQL 5.7+. The following PHP extensions are also required: cURL, DOM, Fileinfo, GD, intl, JSON, libxml, PDO

_Upgrading from an earlier version of Vanilla? See [our upgrade notes](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/installation/self-hosting/#upgrading)._

## Changes to Fulltext Indexing

Full-text index support has been disabled by default as of Vanilla 4. To enable full-text index support, add a `FullTextIndexing` key under the `Database` section of your site config and set its value to `true`. **Failure to add this config value will result in full-text indexes being removed from Vanilla's database tables.**
