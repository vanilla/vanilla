-   Sets its own flyout open/close listeners.
-   Dependency on the [theme-boilerplate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillaforums/theme-boilerplate).

## Building Styles / Javascript / Images

This theme is built with the [Vanilla Cli](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli/) and does not come with its own build toolchain. With that installed you can simply run:

```bash
vanilla build
```

or

```bash
vanilla build --watch
```

to build your styles/js/images. Documentation for the CLI can be found [here](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli/#build-tools).
