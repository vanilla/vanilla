# Vanilla Theme Boilerplate


## Description

Custom theme for Vanilla Theme Boilerplate.


## Notes

- This theme needs the `Feature.NewFlyouts.Enabled` config set as `true` for the flyouts to work properly. 

## Building Styles / Javascript / Images

This theme is built with the [Vanilla CLI](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli/) and does not come with its own build toolchain. With that installed you can simply run:

```bash
vanilla build
```

or

```bash
vanilla build --watch
```

to build your styles/js/images.



Documentation for the CLI can be found [here](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli/#build-tools).
