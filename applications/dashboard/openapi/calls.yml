            summary: Continue running a callbackPayload from a previous API call.
            description: |
                Various endoints may return a 202 status response with
                `callbackPayload` property in the body. Simply pass that
                response to this endpoint to continue processing.

                Endpoints with responses like this are structured as follows:
                1. Call other endpoint.
                2. Endpoint may return 202 with "callbackPayload" and progress.
                3. Pass the callback payload to this endpoint.
                4. This endpoint may return a 202 with another `callbackPayload`
                5. Repeat until task is complete.

                    A secured JWT token containing:
                    - The original request userID.
                    - Instructions for the server on how to resume the original task.
                    - Context about the result of previous attempts.

                    The only way to get one of these payloads is to have it returned
                    from an /api/v2 endpoint as a `callbackPayload`.
