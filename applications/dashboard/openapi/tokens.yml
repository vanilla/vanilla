      summary: Exchange an OAuth access token for a Vanilla access token.
      description: |-
        This endpoint takes an access token from your OAuth 2 provider and exchanges it for a Vanilla access token. If no matching user exists in Vanilla, one will be created and an access token will be issued for them.

        In order to use this endpoint, the access token calls out to the API defined in the OAuth connection so it must have a scope that has access to the user's profile or else it will fail.

        The access tokens provided by this endpoint are relatively short lived, so make sure you take note of the `dateExpires` in the response and have a strategy for refreshing the access token for long lived client sessions.
