<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="Legal">
    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

    <p>Like most website operators, Vanilla collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
        and the date and time of each visitor request. Vanilla&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Vanilla&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Vanilla may
        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
        usage of its website.</p>

    <p>Vanilla also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
        Vanilla does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information,
        other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as
        described below.</p>

    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    <p>Certain visitors to Vanilla's websites choose to interact with Vanilla in ways that require Vanilla to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Vanilla gathers depends on the
        nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a forum at <a
            href="http://www.vanillaforums.com/">vanillaforums.com</a> to provide a username and email address. Those
        who engage in transactions with Vanilla are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the
        personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Vanilla collects such
        information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
        Vanilla. Vanilla does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
        visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent
        them from engaging in certain website-related activities. Vanilla does not keep a copy of any credit card
        information once a transaction is complete.</p>

    <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

    <p>Vanilla may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Vanilla may monitor
        the most popular forums on the VanillaForums.com site. Vanilla may display this information publicly or provide
        it to others. However, Vanilla does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
        below.</p>

    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    <p>Vanilla discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
        it on Vanilla's behalf or to provide services available at Vanilla's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
        disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside
        of your home country; by using Vanilla's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
        Vanilla will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
        anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Vanilla
        discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so
        by law, or when Vanilla believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
        or rights of Vanilla, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Vanilla website
        and have supplied your email address, Vanilla may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
        solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Vanilla and our products. We
        primarily use our various product forums to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type
        of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
        mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
        help us support other users. Vanilla takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
        access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>

    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
        provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Vanilla uses cookies to help Vanilla identify and track
        visitors, their usage of Vanilla website, and their website access preferences. Vanilla visitors who do not wish
        to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Vanilla's
        websites, with the drawback that certain features of Vanilla's websites may not function properly without the
        aid of cookies.</p>

    <h3>Ads</h3>

    <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
        These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
        compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
        other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
        Policy covers the use of cookies by Vanilla and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Vanilla may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
        Vanilla's sole discretion. Vanilla encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
        Privacy Policy. If you have a vanillaforums.com account, you should also check your forum's dashboard for alerts
        to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
        acceptance of such change.</p>
