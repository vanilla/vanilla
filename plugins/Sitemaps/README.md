# Sitemaps

Site map genreation for Vanilla Forums, using the [site map protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).

## Site Map Index

Each community generates a /sitemapindex.xml page, containing a site map for each category. There is a maximum of 50,000 site maps.

## Site map

Each category has its own sitemap, containing links to each discussion. Again, the limit is 50,000 urls.

## Filtering results

If you need to filter out the results, there is an event (siteMapCategories) after the categories are fetched to filter out the results.
