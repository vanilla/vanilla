   <h1>Welcome!</h1>
   <p>Vanilla was born out of the desire to create customizable, integratable, and downright entertaining community solutions. Vanilla has been used to power over 400,000 community forums around the world - We couldn't be happier that you've decided to use Vanilla to grow yours.</p>
   <p style="text-align: right;">- Mark O'Sullivan</p>

   <h1>Requirements</h1>
   <ul>
      <li>PHP version 5.2.0 or newer.</li>
      <li>The pdo_mysql module must be enabled (it is enabled by default, but some web hosts disable it).</li>
      <li>MySQL 5 or newer.</li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Installation</h1>
   <ol>
      <li>Upload this entire file structure up to your web server.</li>
      <li>Navigate to that folder in your web browser.</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions on screen.</li>
   </ol>

   <p>If you run into any issues during your install, it is most often related to file permissions on your server. Try granting PHP write access to the following files & folders:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>/cache/*</li>
      <li>/conf/config.php (if this file doesn't exist, don't worry about it)</li>
      <li>/uploads/*</li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Upgrading from Vanilla 1 to Vanilla 2</h1>
   <p>Some of your customizations to your Vanilla 1 forum (plugins, themes, and translations) will not be easily portable to Vanilla 2. You will most likely need to create a new theme for your forum.</p>
   <p><strong><span style="color: #d00;">Important:</span> Back up all of your existing files and your database.</strong></p>
   <ol>
      <li>Delete all of your Vanilla 1 files.</li>
      <li>Upload this entire file structure to your web server.</li>
      <li>
         Vanilla 2 requires that PHP have read/write access to the following files/folders:
         <ul>
            <li>/conf</li>
            <li>/cache/*</li>
            <li>/uploads/*</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Browse to your Vanilla 2 files in your favourite web browser and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to use the same database that your Vanilla 1 tables are in.</li>
      <li>Browse to http://yourdomain.com/path/to/vanilla/import and follow the instructions.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the role management screen and re-assign each role's permissions.</li>
   </ol>
